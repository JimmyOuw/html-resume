    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      A hardworking and collaborative team player who enjoys pushing his
      boundaries and learning new skills. With a Master’s degree in Animal
      Sciences, I bring a strong academic foundation and a scientific mindset.
      In my free time, I have developed a growing interest in programming — a
      skill I am currently exploring through self-study, with a focus on web
      development and in the future data analysis. I am always eager to connect
      ideas across disciplines and embrace new challenges.
